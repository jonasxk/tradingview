4. Click **"Commit changes"**

## 🚀 **Then Redeploy on Railway**

1. Go back to Railway
2. Your project should **automatically redeploy** when you push to GitHub
3. Or manually click **"Redeploy"** in Railway

The newer versions have pre-built wheels so they won't need to compile, which should fix the build error.

## 🔄 **Alternative: Use Python 3.11 Instead of 3.13**

If the above still fails, Railway might be using Python 3.13 which has compatibility issues. Let's force it to use Python 3.11:

1. In your GitHub repo, create a new file called `runtime.txt`
2. Add this single line:
```
   python-3.11.9
